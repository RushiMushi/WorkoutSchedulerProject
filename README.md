## What does it do?

- This program is meant to be a Windows Form application that is able to determine what your workout schedule should be based on certain goals.

- Workout Class:
  
  - Provides a frame for the workout object that can be initialized with attributes of a certain excercize and creates 
  
  - Provides a function able to create a list of workouts determined on the user input collected through the interface 
  
- Schedule Class:
  
  - Builds the schedule based on the 3 possible days
  
  - Allows for clearing, editing, and moving of workouts from certain days to other days


# Next Steps with this Project
